### Description

The Semantic skeleton is a starter skeleton for Expansive using 
[Semantic-UI](http://semantic-ui.com). It provides a default layout,
partial pages and is configured to use Less stylesheets. Extensions are installed
to process less stylesheets and minify scripts.

The skeleton is configured for a "debug" and "release" mode of operation via the
"mode" property in package.json. By default, debug mode will disable minification and
mangling of scripts.
